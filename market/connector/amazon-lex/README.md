Axon Ivyâ€™s [Amazon Lex API](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) helps you to accelerate process automation
initiatives by introducing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine
Learning (ML) to your process work. Amazon Lex builds sophisticated, natural language, conversional bots (chatbots). This connector:

- Is based on a freemium pricing model by AWS.
- Provides APIs to send user message to bots and vice versa.
- Identifies user intent and additional information collected by the bot.
- Supports you with an easy-to-copy demo implementation to reduce your
  integration effort.

## Demo

### Chat Bot

The chat bot demo is based on the amazon BookTrip demo bot. 
1. Type a booking text you like into the text field like: _I want to book a hotel_ or _I want to book a car_.
2. Answer the questions of the bots
3. Amazon Lex will detect your intent and provides additional information in the confirmation.

Axon Ivy's [Google Map API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display on web pages and mobile devices. The Google Map API features four basic map types (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain) which you can modify using layers and styles, controls and events, and various services and libraries.

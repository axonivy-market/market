# Google MAPs Connector
Axon Ivy's [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)
connector lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display
on web pages and mobile devices. The connector:

- Features four basic map types (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain) which
  you can modify using layers and styles, controls and events, and various
  services and libraries.
- Provides access to the core API of Google Maps Platform
- Supports you with an easy-to-copy demo implementation to reduce your
  integration effort.
- Enables low code citizen developers to integrate common API's without writing
  a single line of code.
